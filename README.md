This project utilizes HTML for structuring the content of the webpage, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactive elements such as button clicks and form submission. HTML is used to create the basic layout and structure of the page, including headers, paragraphs, and forms. CSS is applied to style the elements, defining their colors, sizes, and positions on the page. JavaScript adds interactivity by allowing users to interact with elements, such as displaying a dropdown menu or validating form input. Together, these technologies create a functional and visually appealing webpage for Netflix India.
